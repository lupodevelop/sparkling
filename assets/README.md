# Assets

Place the project logo (image file) here and name it `image.png`.

This folder is referenced from `sparkling/README.md` as `assets/image.png`.

Recommended image formats: PNG (transparent) or SVG (preferred for scalability).

Example:

- `sparkling/assets/image.png`  # project logo used in README
